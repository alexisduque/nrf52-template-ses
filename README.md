nRF52840-DK & nRF52 USB Dongle experimentation

## Setup
A Segger Embedded Studio project that contains build rules to switch between the NRF52840-DK development kit (DK) and the  NRF52840 Dongle (Dongle).

The code is based on the led_softblink example from the SDK.

1. Set up the global macro `$(SDKDir)` in segger to point to the root of your Nordic SDK.
2. Put your project wherever you want and open the solution in Segger.
